# Key Conflict Formulation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides detailed information for each of the ДКЦП (DKCP) pieces listed in the Overview section in the context of key conflicts.

**Note:** If you already have creative ad scripts for analysis in the dialogue, analyze them. If you don't have any, request them by asking to paste a script for analysis and improvement.

Analyze the provided aspects of the creative and define how well and clear each of them is presented in the creative.

## ДКЦП Framework Overview

ДКЦП is a comprehensive framework used to design and articulate value propositions effectively.

### Framework Components

1. **Company Attributes**
   - Defines the organization's identity, values, and capabilities.

2. **Customer Segment**
   - Identifies the specific group of customers targeted, including their characteristics and needs.

3. **Key Motivational Conflict**
   - Explores the primary tension or problem the customer faces, which the product or service aims to resolve.

4. **Artifact**
   - Represents the product or service offered, viewed as a tool to address the customer's conflict.

5. **Artifact Attributes**
   - Details the features and qualities of the product or service that make it suitable for the customer.

6. **Value**
   - Articulates the benefits and improvements the customer gains from the product or service.

7. **Arguments**
   - Crafts the messaging and communication strategies that convey the value proposition to the customer.

8. **Exchange Conditions**
   - Outlines the terms and processes through which the product or service is delivered to the customer.

9. **Price Conditions**
   - Specifies the pricing strategy and how it reflects the value provided.

## Key Conflict Formulation Process

The Key Conflict is one of the components of the DKCP (Palace of Culture of Value Proposition). In the model, it is responsible for the reason that compels the client to purchase an artifact.

### Step 1: Identify the Activity

Determine the Client's Activity within which the conflict will be formulated and the Artifact will be used.

> **Activity** - a specific form of a person's relationship to the surrounding world, the content of which constitutes its (the world's) change in the interests of the person.
> 
> **Subject Area of Activity** - this is the theme of the activity, a characteristic that allows determining the logical (not chronological!) boundaries of the activity.

Activity must always have a subject area. At the same time, the distinctive feature of Activity is the absence of clear time frames. Activity is always "in general" - activities last for a long time and do not have any starting or ending point in time, like "raising children."

**Examples of activities:**
1. Child rearing
2. Company management
3. Music making

### Step 2: Identify Job within the Activity

> **Job** is the general name for efforts applied with the aim of obtaining a reward or desired outcome.

Since we have introduced the concept of reward, we fix the moment of its receipt. This means job is always time-limited. This is how it differs from activity, which is "in general."

**Criteria for formulating job:**
- Limited in time, i.e., has moments of beginning and end
- Implies explicit application of effort
- From the formulation, it should be clear what reward the subject of job expects to receive at the end

To understand job, you can use the following analogy:
- **Activity** – space
- **Job** – vector in this space

Accordingly, to define job, we need to set the coordinates of the beginning and the coordinates of the end (reward)

**Examples of jobs within activities:**

| Activity              | Job                                                                  | Reward                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Child rearing         | Calm a child's tantrum in a public place                            | Silence and the ability to continue with business                                                                   |
| Child rearing         | Teach a life lesson when appropriate circumstances arise            | Sense of duty fulfilled                                                                                             |
| Child rearing         | Choose a gift for a child                                            | Joy from the child's happiness                                                                                      |
| Child rearing         | Establish sleep and wake schedule                                    | Ability to attend to personal matters                                                                               |
| Company management    | Create an in-demand product                                          | Money from sales                                                                                                    |
| Company management    | Assemble a team capable of acting independently                      | Ability to go on vacation and not work from there<br>Ability to focus on development<br>Receiving passive income |
| Music making          | Learn a favorite song                                                | Pleasure from performance                                                                                           |

### Step 3: Formulate Forces Acting Within the Job

From Bob Moesta's 4 Forces of Progress theory and the "Anatomy of Need" material, identify the forces (drivers and barriers) that act within this job.

Use the following forces:

#### Push Forces
**Push** – pushing drivers. Factors that push a person out of the starting point of job.

*Linguistic and logical verification of formulation correctness:* "if (*push driver formulation*), then it is necessary (*job formulation*)"

#### Pull Forces
**Pull** – attracting drivers. Actually, the reward itself and the emotions a person will feel after achieving their goal.

*Linguistic and logical verification of formulation correctness:* "if (*job formulation in completed form*), then (*pull driver formulation*)"

#### Barriers
**Barriers** – factors that hold a person back, preventing them from completing the job.

*Linguistic and logical verification of formulation correctness:* "It is necessary to complete the job (*job formulation in completed form*), but this is hindered by (*barrier formulation*)"

**Barrier Classification:**

1. **By point of impact:**
   - **Habits** – barriers that hold a person at the starting point of job and prevent them from leaving it
   - **Fears** – factors that repel us from the situation when job is completed

2. **By experience in performing the job:**
   - **A priori** – factors that are related to the job itself and exist regardless of attempts to perform the job
   - **A posteriori** – factors that arise only when a person attempts to cope with the job. Mainly, the shortcomings of existing solutions are indicated here.

3. **By observability:**
   - **Environment** – factors that occur outside the person: objects, laws, actions of other people, etc.
   - **Experiences** – internal obstacles: thoughts, negative attitudes, negative feelings

### Step 4: Formulate Key Motivational Conflicts

A Key Motivational Conflict is a contradiction between any driver and any barrier. It is important to understand that we do not invent a conflict for the client, but try to "see" or "reveal" it in the person's reality.

Key conflicts can be divided into organizational and personal:
- **Organizational conflicts** are usually present in a person's collective activity (job, team sports, public organizations, etc.) and describe phenomena related to interaction with other people or job tasks.
- **Personal conflicts** are related to the client's personal life and describe personal matters.

**IMPORTANT: Criteria for a well-formulated (found) key conflict:**
- Contains explicit incompatibility, the stronger -- the more chances we have to convince to buy a product that will help overcome the contradiction
- For organizational conflicts: contain an indication of the loss or damage borne by the organization of which the client is a member
- Can be well and concisely illustrated by a metaphor that conveys the essence of the conflict

## Data Output Format

### Activity Description
*Activity description here*

### Jobs

**# and Job Name**
Reward: *reward description in one sentence*

**Forces Within the Job**

**Push**
- description of forces in one sentence for each force

**Pull**
- description of forces in one sentence for each force

**Barriers**
- Description of barriers, indicating classes. Format: formulation in one sentence (class: e.g., environment, a priori, habit)
- ! Check that among the barriers there are also shortcomings of those **solutions** that a person performing the job might encounter

**Key Motivational Conflicts**
KMC# *driver formulation* vs. *barrier formulation*
Conflict description in the format "wants *indication of driver* ..., but *indication of barrier*"

*Formulate no more than 3 conflicts, the strongest from a client's perspective.*

### Step 5: Perform Final Verification

Perform final verification of the document, ensuring that:

1. **Activity** is described "in general," i.e., does not contain time frames. But contains a subject area

2. **Jobs** are formulated so that:
   - Boundaries are clear (initial event and final event)
   - The reward that a person expects when performing the job is clear. The reward is truly formulated as desirable for the person
   - Progress forces are formulated specifically enough and do not contain obvious generalizations and omissions

3. **IMPORTANT: Conflicts** are formulated so that:
   - They contain explicit incompatibility
   - They contain an indication of loss or damage
   - They can be illustrated by a metaphor
   - There are no more than three of them
